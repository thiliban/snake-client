# Snake Client Project

### Description
The snake game is a game where the snake moves around in a closed area in which there is food, and if the snake eats the food it becomes bigger. This means that the bigger the snake becomes the harder it is to move around the area without it touching the boundaries. Once the snake touches the boundaries the snake dies and the game will come to an end.

### Instructions
1. Open up your `vagrant` folder in your terminal
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/snek-multiplayer.git`
3. From the cloned link, open the folder named `snek-muliplayer`
4. Run `npm install` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run play` in your terminal
6. Have the `snek-multiplayer` server open
7. Run `node play.js` with the client `snake-client` open
8. Use the keys WASD to move the snake in the appropriate direction
9. Move the snake towards the red dot for it to become bigger
10. Using the keys 1,2,3 will give you some messages
11. Avoid running into the boundaries, otherwise the snake will die and the game will end
